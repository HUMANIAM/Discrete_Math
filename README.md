# Discrete_Math_Specialization
this specialization about my studying and training discrete math specialization on coursera. It is divide into 4 courses with good final project about the deliverly problem.

## **Language :** python

## Mathematical thinking in computer science

-  **Making Convincing Arguments**
-  **How to find an example** : brute force, backtraking, optimal solution, simple puzzles
-  **Recursion and Induction** : tower of hanio, binarysearch, proof by induction , contradiction
-  **Logic** : Examples, counterExamples, Logic, antimagic square, pigeonhole Principle, proof by contradiction
-  **Invariant** : Double Counting, invariants, termination, even and odd numbers
-  **project_15_puzzle** : permutations, cycle notation, 15-puzzle, A* serach
<br /> <br />
## Combinatorics and Probability
- **Basic Counting** : rule of sum, rule of product, tuples, comination, permutation, Basic counting principle
- **Binomial Coefficients** : combinatorics, tuples, permutation, pascal's triangle, counting
- **ِِِAdvanced Counting** : combinatorics with repetition, permutation with indistinguishable objects.
- **Probability** : bean-machine, probability calculation, tree diagram, conditional probability, Monty Hall paradox
- **Random Variable and expected value** : random variable, expected value of an expriment, linearity of expectation, Markouv inequality
- **Dice_game_Project** : dice game, probability is tricky and sometimes counter-intuitive

## Introduction To Graph Theory : 
- **What is a Graph?** : directed graphs, undirected graphs, connected components, Guarini puzzle, cyclic graph, apps, bipartite graphs
