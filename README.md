# Discrete_Math_Specialization
this specialization about my studying and training discrete math specialization on coursera. It is divide into 4 courses with good final project about the deliverly problem.

## **Language :** python

## Mathematical thinking in computer science

-  **Making Convincing Arguments**
-  **How to find an example** : brute force, backtraking, optimal solution, simple puzzles
-  **Recursion and Induction** : tower of hanio, binarysearch, proof by induction , contradiction
-  **Logic** : Examples, counterExamples, Logic, antimagic square, pigeonhole Principle, proof by contradiction
-  **Invariant** : Double Counting, invariants, termination, even and odd numbers
