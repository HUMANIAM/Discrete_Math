"""
Travel salesman problem is very popular problem in computer science and used in many many apps
Description: given a set of nodes and edges between them. find the shortest path that visit every
**********   node exactly once

* we can think in this problem as a permutation problem where we find the order of nodes that gives
the shortest path

* complexity of this solution is n!
